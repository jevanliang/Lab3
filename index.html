            Thank goodness it's Friday. At least, that is what I would have said if classes were in person. This quarter has been a new record for me. I stopped attending classes live ever since classes first started, so everyday is pretty much the same to me, regardless of what day of the week it actually is. Still, it would be a lie to say that I did not feel any excitement at all for the end of the week. Unfortunately, that excitement was not put towards anything useful; I ended up spending the entirety of the day playing League of Legends. Is it responsible of me to be playing videogames when I have a lab due for CSE 110? <b class="rip">Of course not.</b> Would I rank up without actually getting on the game? Also nope. I don't think I have made very good decisions ever and one day I will change that. <strong>Today is not that day though; today is the day I rank up.</strong>

            So there was something that went terribly wrong with my rank; I am still the same rank that I was yesterday. Not a concern though, this is what we call a "redemption arc". I will make up for all that I failed to do yesterday.<br>

            <br>I hate this game. I hate this game. I hate this game. Part of me wants to banish this game from my computer and send it to the shadow realm forever but the voices in my head are telling me no. Wait, why are there voices in my head? Is it from that <i class="death">entire chocolate cake</i> that I inhaled. Or is it from the <i class="death">gallon of coffee</i> that I downed. Oh well, that is something for future me to worry about.

            I am both estatic and deeply saddened to say that Casper told me to start being a normal person. For anyone who doesn't know him, Casper is the friendly ghost. I actually have to do work for my classes now. These are the things that I have to get done:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Actually watch any and all lectures</li>
                <li>Take my quiz for <span class="class">CSE110</span></li>
                <li>Finish Lab2 for <span class="ingredient">CSE110</span></li>
                <li>Finish homework for <span class="ingredient">CSE 140</span></li>
                <li>Finish homework for <span class="ingredient">ECE35</span></li>
                <li>Take my quiz for <span class="ingredient">COGS1</span></li>
                <li>Finish up some work for <span class="ingredient">MAE7</span></li>
            </ul>
            Casper is also the the one who told me to take 6 classes this quarter. If you thought that downing a single gallon of coffee yesterday was impressive, me inhaling two gallons today will <em>blow your mind</em>.
